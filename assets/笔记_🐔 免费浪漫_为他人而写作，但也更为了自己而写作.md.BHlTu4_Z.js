I knew that if I wasn’t careful or was indeed careless about what I wrote I’d not only be wasting people’s time but I could be publicly ridiculed on the internet. So I only wrote about things that I had a fundamental understanding of or set about getting that deep understanding that I lacked first.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>在进行了一段时间的技术写作后，令我惊讶的是，<mark>写作不仅仅是我向观众解释一些东西，它还是一种使我的思维严谨的工具。</mark>我关心自己的声誉和潜在读者，因此开始撰写有关技术主题的博客文章最终涉及大量工作。我知道，如果我不小心或者确实粗心我写的东西，我不仅会浪费人们的时间，而且可能会在互联网上受到公开嘲笑。因此，我只写一些我有基本了解的事情，或者着手获得我首先缺乏的深刻理解的事情。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The great thing about writing is that <mark>it uncovers all these areas that you thought you understood but don’t.</mark> This is especially true when you know that competent and knowledgeable people are going to read it. You start explaining something in detail, about how it works, what the trade-offs are, the alternatives and so on and very soon your internal BS detector is going off. It’s yelling “How do you know that!?” and “What evidence do you have for this statement!?”. You realize that your knowledge is based on shaky foundations and your words are worthless. So you set out to learn the missing pieces, search for the insights and fundamental truths so that you can explain all this stuff with authenticity.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>写作的伟大之处在于<mark>它揭示了所有这些你认为你理解但实际上不理解的领域。</mark>当您知道有能力且知识渊博的人会阅读它时尤其如此。你开始详细解释一些事情，关于它是如何工作的、权衡是什么、替代方案等等，很快你的内部 BS 探测器就会启动。它大喊“你怎么知道！？”以及“你有什么证据支持这个说法！？”。你意识到你的知识基础不牢，你的言语毫无价值。所以你开始学习缺失的部分，寻找见解和基本真理，这样你就可以真实地解释所有这些东西。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>After a while of writing my blog I realized that <mark>it had taught me how to think.
